It offers a choice of water temperatures, so it is ideal for making different types of drink, from coffee to herbal teas. To top it all, the styling is immaculate; this is one kettle you’ll be proud to have on your kitchen counter. In short, it’s a great kettle, but you’re going to really have to want it at this price.\\n\\n\\n\\nPros\\nAttractive, sturdy designVariable temperature settingStays warm for longer\\n\\nCons\\nPricey\\n\\nKey Specifications\\nReview Price: £1491.5 litresAdjustable temperature from 50 to 100°C21.8 x 26.3 x 21cmRemovable limescale filter85cm cable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Artisan 1.5L Kettle is part of KitchenAid’s range of premium appliances, known for handsome, sturdy design. While it comes at a hefty price, the Artisan kettle is a pleasure to use. Not only is it fast, it also keeps your water warm for longer.\\nMost importantly, you can specify the water temperature between 50 and 100°C.\\n\\nDesign and features\\nWith a shape reminiscent of a traditional kettle, the KitchenAid Artisan kettle is not the lightest, weighing around 1.3kg without the base. But the sturdiness is part of its charm, as is the retro-looking round temperature gauge on its side, which lets you follow the heating process.\\nThe Artisan kettle is available in six different colours: Empire Red, Candy Apple, Cast Iron Black, Onyx Black, Almond Cream and Medallion Silver. I tested the Empire Red version and can attest that neither the stainless-steel body nor the soft-grip rubber and metal handle showed many fingerprints.\\n\\nOn top of the handle you’ll find a round black button that pops the lid open. Should the metallic lid gets hot, there’s a rubberised area that’s safe to touch. The one niggle here is that the lid will only open part way, so you have to use something to push it open further. It’s fine using your hands when the kettle isn’t warm, but be careful when refilling a hot kettle.\\nThe water indicator is situated behind the handle, a common, albeit annoying, position often used by kettle manufacturers. The markings are clear to read and come in handy 0.25-litre increments.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe controls of the KitchenAid Artisan kettle are located on its base. A sliding knob lets you choose temperatures of 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95 or 100°C, lighting up with each increment like a status bar.\\nThe power switch is slightly out of the way on the side of the base, but once you’re familiar with its location, using it becomes second nature. When you first connect the kettle to a power outlet or start the boiling process, it emits a trill, which also sounds when it has finished heating your water.\\n\\nPerformance\\nThe beauty of a variable-temperature kettle such as the KitchenAid Artisan is that you can heat water to a temperature best suited to your drink of choice. While the optimal temperature for black tea and instant coffee is 90°C, many green teas are best brewed at 70 or 80°C.\\nIt’s important, therefore, that the temperatures a variable-setting kettle purports to offer are accurate. The KitchenAid Artisan kettle produced consistent results across different temperatures, with variations of less than 2°C.\\n\\nTo reach 100°C, the Artisan kettle only took around two minutes 24 seconds when boiling a litre of water – a decent result given that some kettles achieve that temperature in about three minutes.\\nAfter 10 minutes, the water was at 86°C, reducing to 80°C after 20 minutes and 75°C after half an hour. After a full hour the water was still a respectable 65°C.\\nShould I buy it?\\nIf you have the cash to spare and like the KitchenAid Artisan’s sturdy look, then this kettle won’t disappoint. But if you’re after a more affordable variable-temperature kettle, the Sage Smart Kettle comes with an extra keep-warm function.\\n\\nSpecs\\n\\n\\n‹\\n\\n\\n\\nUK RRP\\n\\n\\nManufacturer\\n\\n\\nSize (Dimensions)\\n\\n\\nWeight\\n\\n\\nRelease Date\\n\\n\\nFirst Reviewed Date\\n\\n\\nWater capacity\\n\\n\\nKettle type\\n\\n\\nCordless\\n\\n\\nMultiple temperatures\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tKitchenAid Artisan 1.5L Kettle\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t£149\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tKitchenAid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t218 x 210 x 263 MM\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t900 G\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2019\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t13/07/2019\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1.5 litres\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJug\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n›\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy   Helen Harjak  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                                    Helen writes about home and lifestyle tech for Trusted Reviews, with a focus on helping you get the most out of your domestic appliances.

It looks smart, the water level measures are positioned either side of the kettle and are practical and useful.The handle is easy to grip and the kettle is well balanced. The only slight reservation is the width of the spout -  I find it a little generous.\\n\\n5 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading the comments at the moment.

The lid is both a pro and a con though.It is easy to clean with the lid off as it gives a lot of room for the hand to move around.Whereas to fill it with water, it is not just a click with thumb to open the lid.And other good thing is that there isn't a rod inside which makes it easier for cleaning.\\n\\n2 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading the comments at the moment.

It offers a choice of water temperatures, so it is ideal for making different types of drink, from coffee to herbal teas. To top it all, the styling is immaculate; this is one kettle you’ll be proud to have on your kitchen counter. In short, it’s a great kettle, but you’re going to really have to want it at this price.\\n\\n\\n\\nPros\\nAttractive, sturdy designVariable temperature settingStays warm for longer\\n\\nCons\\nPricey\\n\\nKey Specifications\\nReview Price: £1491.5 litresAdjustable temperature from 50 to 100°C21.8 x 26.3 x 21cmRemovable limescale filter85cm cable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Artisan 1.5L Kettle is part of KitchenAid’s range of premium appliances, known for handsome, sturdy design. While it comes at a hefty price, the Artisan kettle is a pleasure to use. Not only is it fast, it also keeps your water warm for longer.\\nMost importantly, you can specify the water temperature between 50 and 100°C.\\n\\nDesign and features\\nWith a shape reminiscent of a traditional kettle, the KitchenAid Artisan kettle is not the lightest, weighing around 1.3kg without the base. But the sturdiness is part of its charm, as is the retro-looking round temperature gauge on its side, which lets you follow the heating process.\\nThe Artisan kettle is available in six different colours: Empire Red, Candy Apple, Cast Iron Black, Onyx Black, Almond Cream and Medallion Silver. I tested the Empire Red version and can attest that neither the stainless-steel body nor the soft-grip rubber and metal handle showed many fingerprints.\\n\\nOn top of the handle you’ll find a round black button that pops the lid open. Should the metallic lid gets hot, there’s a rubberised area that’s safe to touch. The one niggle here is that the lid will only open part way, so you have to use something to push it open further. It’s fine using your hands when the kettle isn’t warm, but be careful when refilling a hot kettle.\\nThe water indicator is situated behind the handle, a common, albeit annoying, position often used by kettle manufacturers. The markings are clear to read and come in handy 0.25-litre increments.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe controls of the KitchenAid Artisan kettle are located on its base. A sliding knob lets you choose temperatures of 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95 or 100°C, lighting up with each increment like a status bar.\\nThe power switch is slightly out of the way on the side of the base, but once you’re familiar with its location, using it becomes second nature. When you first connect the kettle to a power outlet or start the boiling process, it emits a trill, which also sounds when it has finished heating your water.\\n\\nPerformance\\nThe beauty of a variable-temperature kettle such as the KitchenAid Artisan is that you can heat water to a temperature best suited to your drink of choice. While the optimal temperature for black tea and instant coffee is 90°C, many green teas are best brewed at 70 or 80°C.\\nIt’s important, therefore, that the temperatures a variable-setting kettle purports to offer are accurate. The KitchenAid Artisan kettle produced consistent results across different temperatures, with variations of less than 2°C.\\n\\nTo reach 100°C, the Artisan kettle only took around two minutes 24 seconds when boiling a litre of water – a decent result given that some kettles achieve that temperature in about three minutes.\\nAfter 10 minutes, the water was at 86°C, reducing to 80°C after 20 minutes and 75°C after half an hour. After a full hour the water was still a respectable 65°C.\\nShould I buy it?\\nIf you have the cash to spare and like the KitchenAid Artisan’s sturdy look, then this kettle won’t disappoint. But if you’re after a more affordable variable-temperature kettle, the Sage Smart Kettle comes with an extra keep-warm function.\\n\\nSpecs\\n\\n\\n‹\\n\\n\\n\\nUK RRP\\n\\n\\nManufacturer\\n\\n\\nSize (Dimensions)\\n\\n\\nWeight\\n\\n\\nRelease Date\\n\\n\\nFirst Reviewed Date\\n\\n\\nWater capacity\\n\\n\\nKettle type\\n\\n\\nCordless\\n\\n\\nMultiple temperatures\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tKitchenAid Artisan 1.5L Kettle\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t£149\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tKitchenAid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t218 x 210 x 263 MM\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t900 G\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2019\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t13/07/2019\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1.5 litres\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJug\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n›\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy   Helen Harjak  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                                    Helen writes about home and lifestyle tech for Trusted Reviews, with a focus on helping you get the most out of your domestic appliances.

If youre considering buying an older iPhone to save money, the iPhone 13 is the best choice for most people.It has a lot in common with the iPhone 14, considering both phones run on the same A15 Bionic processor and have a 12megapixel camera system. The iPhone 14s processor has extra GPU core, but those who primarily use their phone for casual gaming, social media, checking email and watching video likely wont mind.The iPhone 13, like the 12 before it, is defined by its squaresided design. It supports 5G, MagSafe charging and has cameras on par with the ones from 2020s topoftheline iPhone 12 Pro Max.But the iPhone 13s best feature is its larger battery that, in our tests, lasted 4.5 hours more on a single charge than the iPhone 12, and nearly 3 hours longer than the new iPhone 14.The 13 also has Cinematic mode, which is basically a video version of Portrait mode, and iOS 17. The iPhone 13 earned a 2021 CNET Editors Choice Award. Just remember the iPhone 13 lacks satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services without a cell service and car crash detection, both of which are available on the iPhone 14 and 15 series.

Kevin HeinzCNETWe test every iPhone in realworld scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new iOS updates or to compare against new phones from competitors like Samsung, Google and OnePlus.PhotographyPhotography is a major focus for the iPhone, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as Action mode that debuted with the iPhone 14 line.Battery lifeBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long the iPhone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, which isnt always included in the initial review and added later in an update.Performance measuringWe use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.We perform processorheavy tasks like editing photos and videos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of the iPhone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models. Some of these tests are added later in updates after the initial review is published.Read MoreHow CNET tests phonesKey terms   eSIMAn eSIM takes all of the important information about your phone account  including its number, wireless carrier and subscription  and stores it in software instead of on a physical SIM card.With the iPhone 14, Apple removed the physical SIM card tray and embraced embedded SIM cards. This means youcant just pluck your SIM card out of your current phone and put it into a new one targetblank. But this shouldnt affect your experience since all the major US carriers anda number of smaller operators work with eSIM. targetblankApple has long supported eSIM, dating back to 2018s iPhone XS, XS Max and XR. When setting up a new iPhone 14, the device will guide you through transferring your current provider over to the new phone. A list of supported wireless networkscan be found on Apples website.iOS 17Apples iOS 17 is the latest iPhone software version. Its on the iPhone 15 by default and is also available as an update for the iPhone XR and later, as well as iPhone SE models from 2020 and 2022. iOS 17 includes new features such as Standby mode, which turns your iPhone into a miniature smart display, improved autocorrect and the new Journal app.iPhone FAQs       How reliable is an iPhone?        Apple has been selling iPhones since 2007. The current lineup was released in September 2023 and all have a dust and water resistance rating of IP68, which means they can survive being submerged under 6 meters of water about 20 feet for 30 minutes. The screens are covered in Apples Ceramic Shield which is a glassceramic material created by Corning, in collaboration with Apple, and consists of nano ceramic crystals embedded in the glass matrix. Its highly transparent, and according to Corning, the tough structure formed by the crystals means its less likely to break.  Show more          How long does an iPhone last?        One way to measure how long an iPhone will last is to look at the software and security support Apple offers for older models. iOS 17 can run on Apple phones as old as 2018s iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and XR. Thats roughly 5 years of software support. Compare that to Samsung, which offers four generations of Android version upgrades and 5 years of security updates. But software is only half the equation. The other part is hardware and durability. Fortunately, every iPhone Apple sells has an IP rating for dust and water resistance. Newer models also have Ceramic Shield, a glassceramic hybrid, that covers the display and is very durable.

Still, its the slickest mobile operating system around.MSRP FreeVisit Site  at Apple.comSee It PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.Pros Slick design Full set of lifestyle tools Excellent included apps FaceTime now works with nonApple devices Strong messaging and calling features Huge library of thirdparty appsCons Many features work only if you and your contacts use other Apple devices Less variety in phone model choices than Android Not as customizable as Android which allows thirdparty skins and launchers Some iPadOS features arent available Just as with other longestablished operating systems, new iOS versions mostly polish the core experience and add a few new tools rather than deliver something completely fresh. iOS 14 was the closest weve seen to a revolutionary change in Apples mobile OS in years. Most notably, it added new widgets and app icon options. iOS 15 has less lofty ambitions, bringing updates to FaceTime, Maps, Notifications, and Photos, as well as new systemwide capabilities. Version 15 may not be the biggest iOS update, but it remains our favorite mobile operating system.New Apple iOS 15.4 FeaturesApple recently released the 15.4 update for iOS and iPadOS. This update comes with many changes and improvements, but the most prominent feature is the ability to unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask via Face ID. Apple states that Face ID works more accurately and securely with fullface recognition, but you can set up your device to unlock when youre wearing a mask. Its a convenient tool to have when entering buildings and maskmandated areas.  You Can Trust Our ReviewsSince 1982, PCMag has tested and rated thousands of products to help you make better buying decisions.Read our editorial mission  see how we test.When active, Face ID identifies and uses the area around your eyes for authentication. We tested Face ID with our glasses on and off, and even with a mask. Our iPhone 13 Pro Max unlocked without issue. We then handed the iPhone to other people to see if we could fool it into unlocking for the wrong person the handset did not. Face ID works with normal glasses, but not sunglasses.Other changes include a new voice for Siri the iPhones digital assistant, improvements to the Scan text feature, 37 new emoji, note functionality for your keychain passwords, antistalking improvements to the AirTag and Find My functions, ultrawide support for the Magnifier in iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, and numerous security updates and bug fixes.Similar Products       4.0  Excellent Google Android 110.00  at AndroidSee ItRead Our Google Android 11 Review    4.5  Outstanding Apple iOS 140.00  at Apple.comSee ItRead Our Apple iOS 14 Review    4.5  Outstanding Apple iOS 130.00  at Apple.comSee ItRead Our Apple iOS 13 Review    4.5  Outstanding Google Android 100.00  at AndroidSee ItRead Our Google Android 10 Review New FaceTime FeaturesApple is finally opening a little crack in its walledgarden approach FaceTime now lets you create a group video chat with Android and Windows users via a web link. The experience is not as immediate or highquality on nonApple devices, however. The person who starts the video room on an Apple device has to approve nonApple users admission, and participants can use only native browsersforget Firefox. Note that nonApple devices cant start a call, they can only join one created by an Apple user. In testing, we even got a useless, distorted view when trying it from a Pixel 4 XL, as you can see below. In all fairness, the feature is still in beta release. We did get FaceTime to work on a Windows PC in the Edge browser, but the image quality wasnt as good as when we tested it using all Apple devicesFaceTime in iOS 15 also sports some new visual and audio capabilities. Like Zoom, FaceTime video calls now have a Portrait mode that blurs the background and a grid view that shows participants in even rows and columns. For some reason, iOS 15 doesnt get iPadOS 15s Center Stage feature, in which the camera follows you around in the frame. We expect its because youre more likely to be holding your phone than setting it down and walking around as you might with an iPad, though some phone users may beg to differ.As for new audio capabilities, FaceTime now can take advantage of Spatial Audio and Voice Isolation mode. The first mode requires AirPods Pro 199 orAirPods Max 499, which include hardware that tracks your head position so that the sound sources remain in fixed apparent positions. Voice Isolation is one of three mic options in the Control Center pulldown menu, and it blocks out ambient noise. The other new choice is Wide Spectrum, which picks up all the ambient sound. The third option, Standard, behaves like the earlier iOS versions, using some isolation while still allowing some ambient noise.SharePlay, another new FaceTime feature for iOS, is now available. SharePlay lets you and your pals stay in touch while watching a show or listening to music. The entertainment is synced for all participants, and they can chat in a small Messages box and see each other in thumbnail videos. It works between different Apple devices Apple TV 4K, HomePod, Mac, and iPad. Anyone in the call can use the Play, Pause, Rewind or Fast Forward controls for the playing media. Also new is screensharing capability. New Focus ModesScreen addiction is a real problem that Apple has tried to address with several iOS releases. ScreenTime is the bestknown example. New for iOS 15 are Focus options, which expand the capabilities of the existing Do Not Disturb mode. Notifications only come through based on your current Focus mode. Work, personal time, sleep, fitness, mindfulness, gaming, reading, and driving all receive different levels of notifications.Contacts not allowed through for a Focus mode will see your unavailable status in Messenger and some thirdparty apps, but an Urgent Message option lets them break through for emergencies. Your Focus status is synced to all your Apple devices. As you might expect, for all the features to work, your contacts must be using Apple devices, too.Redesigned Apps Maps, Messages, and MoreThe Maps app seems to get updates every year to pull it closer to the marketleading Google Maps, and, we must say, its gotten darned close. It even beats the incumbent in some areas. You can start with a Google Earthlike globe overview, and at the other extreme, local detail is often breathtaking. Directions are enhanced with a 3D view that makes it clear which road level is above or below with overpasses and bridgesalways a bugaboo for online maps. New transit features tell you when the next bus or train will arrive nearby like the popular Transit app, while local place cards, search, and curated Guides all see improvements.Messages now enable Shared with You content that branches out to other iOS apps. For example, if someone shares a webpage link with you in Messages, it shows up in a Shared with You section in Safarilikewise for Photos, News, and Podcasts. You can continue the conversation in the nonMessages app and pin shared items of particular interest. A new view of shared photos, links, files, and locations appears on a contact or groups info page.iOS 15 wouldnt be complete without some new Memoji options. There are new clothes, eyeglasses, and headwear for your Memoji. Accessibility options let users of cochlear implants, oxygen tubes, or soft helmets represent themselves more accurately.Most of whats new in the stock Photos app involves Memories, those automatically created, shareable slideshows. You can finally choose what pictures you want to include, and there are new Apple Music options for background soundtracks. The Memories themselves are more interactive you can swipe back and forward, they represent more international holidays, and they can identify individual cats and dogs. Some photos get extra information indicated with a star splash next to the i in the info panelwhen the system recognizes a particular landmark, for example.Another cool new photo feature in iOS 15 is Live TextApples name for OCR, or optical character recognition. This identifies any text in photos and lets you copyandpaste it or look it up. The lookup presents a panel along the bottom with relevant info on the text found. Brackets appear around what the phone determines is text. You tap and hold a finger to select and act on the text. It works not only in the Photos app but also in the camera and other Apple apps that show photos.Caption Note the yellow outlines in the photo on the left showing text. In the middle shot, you can see where Ive selected text. On the right, you can see Look Up results.Apples default web browser, Safari, finally sheds the annoying 3D tab view for the standard grid layout for when youre switching tabs. It also moves the searchandaddress bar to the bottom of the screen, which is far more convenient and allows for onehand operation. You can also swipe the search bar left or right to switch between tabsa nice browsing innovation. New custom start page setups are available for your Safari browsing. You get a choice of slick backgrounds or can add any from your photos. Microsofts Edge browser also available for iPhone more usefully lets you populate the start screen with interests like news, sports, stocks, and weather information.Caption Left Safari now shows tabs as tilesmuch better than the 3D shuffle of yore. Center Note that the Address bar is now at the bottom, and you can switch between tabs by swiping that left or right. Right You can customize your browser start page with wallpaper and other options.Speaking of Weather, Apple has upped its game in that department since its acquisition of the Dark Sky app. New maps in the Apple Weather app show precipitation, air quality, and temperature. You can also have it notify you when rain or other weather events are stopping or starting. One thing we miss thats available on Android is the ability to see weather information on the lock screen with a glance. The detailed information Apple gives, however, is excellent, though its still hard to beat the Weather.com app for accuracy.Though iOS 15 doesnt get the new Quick Notes feature that just arrived on iPadOS 15 you can read them but not create them, the iPhone version of Notes sees some worthwhile updates. Foremost among these is a new keyword tagging feature. You can enter a tag by prefixing a word in the note with a pound sign . You can then browse notes by keywords or by scanning automatic folders based on tags. The same tag options come to the Reminders app. As you do in social networks, you can now add an  sign to a note to notify a collaborator.The Apple Translate app arrived in iOS 14, but the iOS 15.1 update adds support for Taiwanese Mandarin, for a total of 11 languages plus two regional dialects for English and Chinesestill far short of Google Translate and Microsoft Translators more than 70 languages.Even More Privacy and SecurityThough security and privacy issues have gotten Apple some bad press recently, one tidbit of interest that Apple didnt make much of at its iOS launch event the operating system now includes builtin authenticator app functionality. This produces those sixdigit timebased codes use for multifactor authentication aka twofactor authentication, or 2FA.Another new privacy option in iOS 15 is the App Privacy Report, which shows you which apps have been accessing your location, photos, mic, and so on recently. App developers can now offer secure copy and pasting as well as photo and location sharing in their apps. Siri and Safari search get enhanced child protections as well. Finally, the Mail app can now hide your IP address from senders if your an iCloud subscriber, something for which youd normally need a VPN.Small Changes to an Excellent OSiOS 15 delivers a smooth and stylish smartphone operating system thats more consistent than what Android offers. Apple does this by limiting the access and customizabilityfor example, you cant access all of the files on your phone as you can on Android, and Googles mobile OS allows far more customizability in the home screen, lock screen, and default apps. Both OSes offer huge stores packed with thirdparty apps and mobile games, but those on iOS tend to work more smoothly, and integrate better with native features.As mentioned earlier, bigger developments for iOS arrived in version 14, but iOS 15 adds some definite conveniences, such as Focus, Shared With Me, Live Text, and improvements to stock apps like Face ID, FaceTime, Notes, Photos, and Weather. Add those to a recent updates widget and app library capabilities, and its an operating system to be reckoned with.Apples otherwise rocksolid smartphone OS had been starting to show some cracks, with so many required updates and occasional snags. But in testing the new OS on an iPhone 12 and 13, we didnt run into any app crashes or the sort of nonresponsiveness Ive occasionally experienced on older iPhones. As always with Apple, youll have the best results if you continually buy the latest hardware. If you do, youll enjoy the very best experience with the smoothest smartphone OS around, but even older handsets should benefit from upgrading to iOS 15. For all these reasons, iOS 15 is our Editors Choice winner for mobile operating systems.

They are joined by the profocused iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone Pro Max, which come with additional capabilities and features and start at 999.As with the iPhone 14 lineup last year, the iPhone 15 family includes a total of four models with two 6.1inch iPhones and two 6.7inch iPhones. The consumer lineup includes the standard 6.1inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7inch iPhone 15 Plus. The 6.1inch iPhone 15 Pro and 6.7inch iPhone 15 Pro Max represent the more expensive, higherend models.As with the iPhone 14 lineup, the best features are reserved for the iPhone 15 Pro models to make the extra cost worth it, but the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are still very capable devices.The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are each available in five color options pink, yellow, green, blue, and black. Perhaps the most significant change for the lineup is a move from the Lightning port that has been present on every iPhone for over a decade to a USBC port, although data transfers on these models remain at the same USB 2.0 speeds that were available with Lightning.New for the nonPro lineup in 2023 is the Dynamic Island, which debuted in the iPhone 14 Pro lineup a year earlier. The Dynamic Island replaces the previous notch at the top of the display and houses the frontfacing TrueDepth camera and other sensors. Software helps hide these physical components inside the black Dynamic Island, which fluidly adapts to display important information and allow for user interaction.The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus use the same A16 Bionic chip that debuted in the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, using 20 percent less power and delivering improved performance and 50 percent more memory bandwidth compared to the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus.Camera improvements include a new 48megapixel Main camera with a quadpixel sensor that defaults to capturing 24megapixel photos. The updated Main camera also allows for a new 2x Telephoto option intelligently cropped from the full camera capture.Portraits no longer require switching Portrait mode, with the iPhone 15 automatically capturing depth information when a person, dog, or cat is detected in the frame. The new camera system also brings sharper detail, more vivid colors, and improved lowlight performance to portraits, while Night mode sees similar improvements.A secondgeneration Ultra Wideband chip delivers enhanced proximitybased functionality, allowing iPhones to connect to each other at three times the range as before. With Precision Finding in the Find My app, you can track down your friends even in a dense crowd.Battery life remains the same on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus compared to their predecessors, with video playback for up 20 hours on the iPhone 15 and 26 hours on the iPhone 15 Plus. As with the last several generations, the iPhone 15 models support 5G connectivity both sub6GHz and mmWave in the United States, and they use a new Qualcomm X70 modem. In the United States, iPhone models again ship without a physical SIM card as carriers now use eSIM.Emergency SOS via satellite debuted with the iPhone 14 lineup, and this year it is expanding to include Roadside Assistance via satellite. Apple is partnering with service agencies such as AAA in the United States to allow users experiencing vehicle difficulties while out of cell signal range to request service, either as part of their AAA membership or on a fee basis.The iPhone 15 models are available in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage capacities. In addition to wired charging via USBC, wireless charging via MagSafe and Qi2 is also supported. The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus support WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3.Pricing on the iPhone 15 models remains the same as the previous models, with the standard 6.1inch device starting at 799 and the 6.7inch iPhone 15 Plus starting at 899.Note See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback?

If you need more storage space, there are options to upgrade to higher storage capacities at an additional cost.The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are available for purchase from the online Apple Store, Apple retail stores, carriers, and other authorized thirdparty retailers.ReviewsThe iPhone 15 received positive reviews, and most reviewers believe that the new iPhone 15 and 15 Plus provide a significant upgrade to the standard iPhone.Apple is using a new matte glass for the back of the iPhone, which was universally popular thanks to its almost softtothetouch finish, as was the new contoured design. playThe swap to USBC was seen as a positive change, though reviewers were not pleased with the limited USB 2.0 speeds that offer no improvements over Lightning. Changing to Lightning will also require tossing out all Lightning cables, but not having to carry multiple cables for Macs and iPads is a positive. playWith the 48megapixel camera for highresolution photos and the 2x optical zoom option, the iPhone 15 camera is a major improvement that was praised by reviewers.To see all of the iPhone 15 reviews, we have a dedicated review roundup.DesignThe 6.1inch iPhone 15 and 6.7inch iPhone 15 Plus measured diagonally at the display have the same general design as the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, but with more contoured edges that change the feel of the devices in the hand and lend a more modern look that sets the new iPhones apart from last years models. Little has changed in terms of specific dimensions. The iPhone 15 measures in at 5.81 inches 147.6 mm tall and 2.82 inches 71.6 mm wide, while the iPhone 15 Plus measures in at 6.33 inches 160.9 mm tall and 3.06 inches 77.8 mm wide. Both models are 0.31 inches 7.80 mm thick, with the iPhone 15 weighing 6.02 ounces 171 grams and the iPhone 15 Plus weighing 7.09 ounces 201 grams. The iPhone 15 models feature an allglass front and a colorful, matte glass back that is framed by a colormatched aerospacegrade aluminum frame. Available colors include black, blue, green, yellow, and pink. This year, Apple used a new process to infuse color throughout the back glass, and it has been strengthened with what Apple describes as a dualion exchange process.Apple last year added a Dynamic Island to the iPhone 14 Pro, replacing the notch at the top of the display, and this year, the pillshaped Dynamic Island has expanded to the iPhone 15 models. The Dynamic Island takes up less space than the notch, allowing for more viewable display area. A set of antenna bands is located at the top and sides of the phone, and there is a power button on the right side and volume buttons and a mute switch on the left. Apple replaced the mute switch with an Action button in the iPhone 15 Pro models, but not the standard iPhone 15 models. Underneath the power button, theres a 5G mmWave antenna, but this is limited to iPhone 15 models sold in the United States. Speaker holes and a microphone are located on the bottom of the iPhone 15 models, along with another major design change  a USBC port. The USBC port replaces the Lightning port as Apple has swapped to USBC charging technology. In some countries, there is a SIM slot on the iPhone, but the physical SIM has been eliminated in the U.S. The camera bump at the back of the iPhone is largely unchanged, and it features a diagonal lens setup for the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras along with a True Tone flash and a microphone. Water and Dust ResistanceThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus have an IP68 rating for resistance to water and dust intrusion. The smartphones are able to withstand a depth of up to six meters 19.7 feet for up to 30 minutes.In the IP68 number, the 6 refers to dust resistance and means the iPhone 15 can hold up to dirt, dust, and other particulates, while the 8 pertains to water resistance. IP6x is the highest dust resistance rating that exists. With the IP68 rating, the iPhone 15 can withstand splashes, rain, and accidental water exposure, but intentional water exposure should be avoided.Water and dust resistance are not permanent conditions, according to Apple, and can deteriorate over time as a result of normal wear. Apples standard warranty does not cover liquid damage, which means its best to use caution when it comes to liquid exposure.DisplayCompared to last years iPhone models, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have the same OLED Super Retina XDR display, but with improvements to brightness for better performance in the sunlight and better HDR. Typical max brightness is now 1000 nits up from 800, while peak HDR brightness is 1600 nits up from 1200. Apple also says that the iPhone 15 models can reach 2000 nits peak brightness outdoors, a display feature introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro model last year and expanded to the standard iPhone 15 models this year.The iPhone 15 has a resolution of 2556 by 1179 with 460 pixels per inch, while the iPhone 15 Plus has a resolution of 2796 by 1290 with 460 pixels per inch.There is a 2,000,0001 contrast ratio unchanged, and wide color support offers vivid, truetolife colors, and True Tone matches the white balance of the display to the ambient lighting for a paperlike viewing experience thats easier on the eyes. Theres also a fingerprintresistant oleophobic coating and support for Haptic Touch, which provides haptic feedback when interacting with the display.The display continues to be protected by a Ceramic Shield material that is made by infusing nanoceramic crystals into glass. The ceramic crystals were manipulated to optimize for clarity while maintaining toughness, with the display created in partnership with Corning. According to Apple, Ceramic Shield is the toughest smartphone glass, with a dualion exchange process ensuring protection against scratches and everyday wear and tear.The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus do not support the ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate or the AlwaysOn display technologies available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. Dynamic IslandNew to the iPhone 15 lineup this year is the Dynamic Island, which houses the TrueDepth camera sensor for Face ID and the frontfacing camera. The proximity sensor for the setup is now under the display, and smaller cutouts are used for the camera, dot protector, and other components. The display has a small circular cutout on the right side thats for the camera, and a pillshaped cutout on the left side for the TrueDepth system for Face ID. Apple is using software to combine these two cutouts into one pillshaped cutout that makes up the Dynamic Island.Apple has turned the Dynamic Island into part of the iPhones interface, and it is used as a frontandcenter information hub for notifications and other ataglance information from apps and services. When you make an Apple Pay payment, for example, Dynamic Island expands into a square shape to confirm your Face ID scan, and when on a phone call, it expands so you have phone controls at your fingertips. It can display everything from Maps directions to timers to Apple Music and the AirPods connection status. It integrates with Live Activities for tracking sports scores, Uber rides, and more right from the top of the iPhones display without leaving the app youre in, plus it can collapse down or open up when tapped. A16 Bionic ChipApple is using the same A16 Bionic chip that was in the iPhone 14 Pro models for the iPhone 15 lineup. The A16 has two highperformance cores and four highefficiency cores, offering modest improvements over the A15 chip.With its 6core CPU and 5core GPU, the A16 Bionic chip has earned a singlecore score of 2522 on Geekbench and a multicore score of 6397. It is second only to the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro models in terms of Aseries chip performance.Neural Engine and ISPTheres an updated 16core Neural Engine in the A16, and it is capable of nearly 17 trillion operations per second. The A16 chip also includes an image signal processor that powers the photographic features of the iPhone 15 models, with up to four trillion operations performed per photo. RAMThere is 6GB RAM in the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, the same amount of RAM that was in the iPhone 14 models.Storage SpaceStorage space starts at 128GB for the most affordable versions of the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, but 256GB and 512GB options are available at increased prices. USBC PortThe iPhone 15 models are the first to feature a USBC port instead of a Lightning port, allowing them to be charged with a USBC cable. With this change, the same cord can be used for charging the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and AirPods Pro 2 with USBC charging case. USBC allows an iPhone to directly charge AirPods or an Apple Watch using a USBC cable, and the iPhone is able to provide up to 4.5W.On the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, the USBC port is limited to USB 2 transfer speeds of 480 Mbs, the same as Lightning. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max support faster USB 3 transfer speeds up to 10 Gbs. TrueDepth Camera and Face IDThe iPhone 15 models continue to use Face ID, Apples facial recognition system. Face ID is now baked into the Dynamic Island, which functions the same as the notch that was available on the iPhone 14 models. Face ID is used across iOS for unlocking the iPhone, allowing access to thirdparty passcodeprotected apps, confirming app purchases, authenticating Apple Pay payments, and more. Face ID works through a set of sensors and cameras. A Dot Projector projects tens of thousands of invisible infrared dots onto the surface of the skin to create a 3D facial scan that maps the curves and planes of each face, with the scan read by an infrared camera.The facial depth map is relayed to the A16 chip where it is transformed into a mathematical model that the iPhone uses to authenticate identity. Face ID works in low light and in the dark, and with hats, beards, glasses, sunglasses, scarves, masks, and other accessories that partially obscure the face.FrontFacing CameraThe iPhone 15 models include the same 12megapixel frontfacing camera with an 1.9 aperture that was available in the iPhone 14 lineup. The frontfacing camera has a builtin Retina Flash, and it supports almost all of the same features available in the rear cameras. Apple has included selfie Night mode, improved Smart HDR 5 integration, Dolby Vision HDR recording, Deep Fusion to bring out fine details, a Photonic Engine that improves lowlight performance, and nextgeneration Portrait mode that lets you take images and turn them into portrait shots later.4K video recording, QuickTake video, slomo video, Portrait mode, Portrait Lighting, and the Photographic Styles feature for selectively applying edits are also supported on the frontfacing camera.DualLens Rear CameraApple made major improvements to the duallens camera system used in the iPhone 15 models, introducing a new 48megapixel Main camera that is notably better than the 12megapixel Main camera used in the iPhone 14. The camera features a 26 mm focal length with 1.6 aperture that lets in plenty of light for situations where lighting is not optimal. Apple added sensorshift optical image stabilization for less movement and crisper photos and videos, with the lens supporting both 24megapixel and 48megapixel highresolution images. With the 24megapixel option, every two pixels are combined into one pixel, allowing for highresolution images that have impressive detail and lowlight performance without too large of a file size. 48megapixel images are also supported, and this year, can be saved in either RAW or HEIF format. The upgrade to the 48megapixel lens allowed Apple to add a 2x Telephoto option that uses the middle 12 megapixels on the sensor for fullresolution 2x photos with no digital zoom. There is no optical zoom lens on the iPhone 15, and this is the first time Apple has enabled any kind of optical zoom option on a standard iPhone. Along with the 48megapixel Main camera, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 have a 12megapixel Ultra Wide camera with an 2.4 aperture and 120 field of view. It is identical to the Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 14 models.Video CapabilitiesThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus offer up to 4K video recording at 24, 25, 30, or 60 frames per second. HDR recording, ProRes video, Cinematic mode, Action mode, slomo video, and timelapse are all supported. Portrait Mode UpdateApple overhauled Portrait mode with the iPhone 15 lineup, and there is no longer a need to specifically choose Portrait mode before capturing an image. You can now snap a photo and if there is a person or pet, depth information is collected and Portrait mode is enabled automatically with a blurred background effect. This also works if you tap to focus on an area in an image, and you can turn it on or off in the Photos app.The degree of background blur can be adjusted as usual, and you can also shift the focus between objects that are in the scene in the Photos app. Apple says that Portrait images feature more detail and richer color, even in Night mode. Other Camera FeaturesThere are several other camera bells and whistles that Apple has been adding to the iPhones over the years.Smart HDR 5  Recognizes one or more people in a scene and optimizes contrast, lighting, and even skin tones for each person so everyone looks their best. Smart HDR was been upgraded in the iPhone 15 to deliver better color and more truetolife skin tones. Photonic Engine  The Photonic Engine combines the best pixels from a highresolution image and an image optimized for light capture, leading to a 24megapixel image with detail drawn from an image twice the resolution.Photographic Styles  Smart, adjustable filters that can do things like boost or mute colors without affecting skin tone. Styles apply selectively to an image, unlike a filter thats applied to the entire image. Photographic Styles include Vibrant boosts colors, Rich Contrast darker shadows and deeper colors, Warm accentuates golden undertones, or Cool accentuates blue undertones. Tone and Warmth are customizable for each style, so you can get the exact look that you want.Night mode  Takes a series of images over a few seconds and aggregates them to allow for photography in extreme low lighting situations. Night mode scenes feature richer color and sharper detail with the iPhone 15.Deep Fusion  Works in mid to low lighting conditions and brings out the texture and detail in the image.Portrait Lighting  Changes the lighting of Portrait mode photos with effects that include Natural, Studio, Contour, Stage, Stage Mono, and HighKey Mono.True Tone flash  True Tone flash is the builtin flash, and it is designed to match the ambient lighting so it doesnt throw off the white balance of the photo when used. The iPhone 15 flash is brighter and it has more consistent lighting.Cinematic mode  A video mode that keeps the focus on the main subject that youre filming even as you move.Action mode  Enhances image stabilization to improve shaky handheld video.Panorama  Captures panoramic shots up to 63 megapixels.Burst mode  Allows a series of images to be captured all at once, which is good for highaction shots.Battery LifeThere is a 3,349 mAh battery in the iPhone 15, while the iPhone 15 Plus has a 4,383 mAh battery, both just a bit highercapacity than the batteries from the respective priorgeneration models. The iPhone 15 offers up to 20 hours of battery life for video playback, up to 16 hours for streaming video playback, and up to 80 hours for audio playback. The iPhone 15 Plus offers up to 26 hours of video playback, up to 20 hours of streaming video playback, and up to 100 hours of audio playback. All iPhone 15 models are fastcharge capable and can charge up to 50 percent in 30 to 35 minutes with a 20W or higher power adapter. iPhone 15 models show the battery cycle count for the first time, and there is also a builtin setting to prevent an iPhone from charging past 80 percent to preserve battery health.How to Check Battery Cycle Count on iPhone 15How to Prevent Your iPhone 15 Battery Charging Beyond 805G ConnectivityThe iPhone 15 models are equipped with a nextgeneration Qualcomm Snapdragon X70 modem that supports 5G connectivity. Qualcomm says that the X70 modem features the first 5G AI system in a modem system, using AI to enable faster 5G speeds, better coverage, lower latency, and improved power efficiency.In the United States, iPhone owners can connect to both mmWave and sub6GHz networks, while other countries are limited to sub6GHz. mmWave 5G networks are the fastest 5G networks, but mmWave is shortrange and can be obscured by buildings, trees, and other obstacles, so its use is limited to major cities and urban areas along with venues like stadiums, airports, and other places where a lot of people congregate. Sub6GHz 5G is more widespread and available in urban, suburban, and rural areas across the United States and other countries. For the most part, when you use a 5G network, youll be using sub6GHz 5G. Sub6GHz 5G is typically faster than LTE, especially when midband spectrum is used, but it isnt always the blazing fast 5G that you expect. 5G BandsThe iPhone 15 models in the United States support more than 20 5G bands. The following bands are supported Sub6GHz 5G  5G NR Bands n1, n2, n3, n5, n7, n8, n12, n14, n20, n25, n26, n28, n29, n30, n38, n40, n41, n48, n53, n66, n70, n71, n77, n78, n79mmWave 5G  Bands n258, n260, n261LTE BandsThe iPhone 15 models continue to offer Gigabit LTE with 4x4 MIMO for connecting to LTE networks when 5G is unavailable. The following bands are supportedFDDLTE  Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71TDLTE  Bands 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48, 53Emergency SOS via SatelliteAll iPhone 15 models can connect to satellites in emergency situations when cellular and WiFi connections are not available. Apple has designed the new Emergency SOS via satellite feature to allow the iPhones antennas to connect to satellites operated by Globalstar. Satellite communications are available in emergency situations where you cant connect to WiFi or a cellular tower, and the feature is designed to be used in open spaces with few trees so the iPhone can connect to a satellite thats in the sky. Apple has a walkthrough interface that instructs you how to hold the iPhone to connect to a satellite, and the company has developed a compressed messaging protocol because sending data via satellite can take minutes. In an area with no trees, a short message to emergency services can send in as little as 15 seconds. Emergency SOS via satellite provides a series of important questions that you answer when it is activated, with these questions aimed at getting necessary details to emergency personnel as quickly as possible. The answers that you provide are sent directly to emergency services if text communication is supported in your area, or sent to relay centers staffed by Appletrained specialists who can call emergency services on the users behalf. Satellite connectivity is mainly designed to allow users to contact emergency services in dire situations, but it can also be used to update your Find My location if youre camping or hiking off the grid, giving your family and friends peace of mind about where you are. iPhone 14 How to Demo or Use the Emergency SOS via Satellite ServiceHow to Share Your Location via Satellite With Find MyEmergency SOS via satellite is free for all iPhone 15 users for two years, and Apple has not yet provided details on what it will cost in the future. Apple with the iPhone 15 also added Roadside Assistance via satellite, which allows U.S. iPhone users to contact AAA for help if they have car trouble in an area without cellular or WiFi connectivity. There is no charge for the satellite usage with Roadside Assistance, but a AAA membership or onetime fee for the AAA help is required.Crash DetectionTheres a high dynamic range gyroscope and a dualcore accelerometer capable of detecting Gforce measurements of up to 256Gs in the iPhone 15 models, and paired with other iPhone sensors like a barometer that can detect cabin pressure changes caused by deployed airbags, this hardware enables a Crash Detection feature. The iPhone 15 models can detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services when the cars occupants are seriously injured or unable to reach their phones. The GPS in the iPhone is able to detect speed changes, and the microphone is able to recognize loud sounds associated with severe car crashes. Crash Detection is also available on the Apple Watch, and the iPhone and Apple Watch work together to contact emergency services when an accident occurs. How Crash Detection Works and How to Turn It OffBluetooth, WiFi, NFC, GPS, and Ultra WidebandThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus support WiFi 6 802.11ax with 4x4 MIMO, and Bluetooth 5.3. Theres an NFC chip with reader mode, and a secondgeneration Ultra Wideband chip. The new Ultra Wideband chip provides improved spatial awareness, allowing iPhone 15 models to more precisely locate other Apple devices with an Ultra Wideband chip. The chip allows two iPhones to connect to each other at three times the range as before. The Ultra Wideband chip can be used for precision tracking, such as when locating AirTags. It is also used for directional AirDrop and for interactions with the HomePod mini, plus Apple has added a Precision Finding feature for locating friends with an iPhone 15 in a crowded area.As for GPS, the iPhone 15 models support GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, and BeiDou location services.MagSafeThere continue to be MagSafe magnets at the back of the iPhone 15 models, with those magnets able to connect to the MagSafe charger and other magnetic accessories. Official MagSafe chargers from Apple and authorized third parties can wirelessly charge the iPhone 15 models at up to 15W. Secondgeneration Qibased charging is also available, but it still maxes out at 7.5W and does not support faster charging.iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro MaxApple is selling the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus alongside the more expensive iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, which are quite an upgrade this year. Compared to the iPhone 15 models, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max feature a lighter, more durable titanium frame, a faster and more efficient A17 Pro chip built on a new 3nanometer process, ProMotion display technology, an AlwaysOn display, and 3x and 5x Telephoto camera lenses, respectively. More information about the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max can be found in our roundup.Beyond the iPhone 15Apple is already working on the iPhone 16 lineup, which will arrive in 2024. As with the iPhone 15 lineup, many of the most cuttingedge changes will be aimed primarily at the iPhone 16 Pro models.

      "Hello there! Based on the context, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max are some of the best phones released by Apple or any phone maker this year. The iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max have a lighter and more comfortable build, a new shortcut button, and the world's smallest processor. It also has a USBC port for more convenient charging, a colorful matte design, and an improved camera that can automatically take people and pet portraits. The Dynamic Island brings better multitasking, and the 5x optical zoom adds versatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pros of the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max include its lighter and more comfortable build, A17 Pro for console video games, being able to change the focus in Portrait photos, and easier and cheaper repair back glass. The cons include the action button can only trigger one action, the baseline 15 Pro Max is 100 more, and the only color option is blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max are excellent phones with many great features. The improved camera, USBC port, and Dynamic Island make it a great upgrade for those with older iPhones. The only downside is the limited color option and the higher price tag.\n"
